          Our society today may be leagues, even galaxies ahead of the past. Yet, somehow, the pursuit for true justice still prevails. It’s the 21st century but the bitter truth is that many people continue to face discrimination for a myriad of reasons, with sexual orientation being one of them. An individual gets ostracised from their communities just because they can’t help but love who they love. And frankly, enough is finally enough.

          Because since when did we have the right to decide who can love who? To insert ourselves in a narrative that isn’t ours to begin with? Love is an emotion too profound to try and restrain. At its purest, love knows no bounds, no labels, no colours, no race, no nothing. And perhaps this is what they mean by love is blind.
          <br> <br>
          It’s  simple, really. Just choose to love without reservations. Love for love’s sake because life is more than a dichotomy. It’s not always black or white; there’s grey too. One day, we’ll further realise this ‘greyscale’ world of ours is a full spectrum of colours.
